        106).
            ``(2) Exceptions.--The term `applicable employer-sponsored

                is not allowable.
            ``(3) Coverage includes employee paid portion.--Coverage 
        shall be treated as applicable employer-sponsored coverage 
        without regard to whether the employer or employee pays for the 
        coverage.
            ``(4) Governmental plans included.--Applicable employer-
        sponsored coverage shall include coverage under any group 
        health plan established and maintained primarily for its
